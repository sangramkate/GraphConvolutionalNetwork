# Introduction
This repo is an implementation for Graph Convolutional network as a part of project for CS380C: Compiler course at the University of Texas at Austin.

# Graph Convolution Network

# How to run
You need to make sure that you support cuda compilation through nvcc.
You can use the make file to compile whole project. 
Command to compile: Make all (this will generate an executable file called run_test)
command to run the code: ./run_test
